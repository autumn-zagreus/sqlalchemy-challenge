# sqlalchemy-challenge
A repository to hold files for Module 10 Challenge
The first half of this module assignemnts is held in climate_starter.ipynb (done at Jupyter Notebooks), and the second half is held in app.py (done in Visual Studio Code).
I was able to import and run everything fine in Visual Studio easily the first time around, but the second time around, I was not.
As of right now, I don't know why this happened.

In the first section of climate_starter.ipynb, we imported everything needed for this portion of the module, and then reflected the tables from the hawaii sqlite database into a new model.
We then created a plot to show precipitation over time, and showed some descriptive statistics for precipitation.
Lastly, we created a table from temperature data from different stations.

In app.py, we created an API to show the precipitation in the previous year, the stations, the previous year's temperatures, and created a route to show temperatures before, after, or between certain dates.
